1. ok, first off I didn't check in to a git repo regularly while writing this code. Neither did I want to "stage" 
	it after the fact. I hope it's not a deal breaker. To be honest when I did use git regularly, at the mailonline,
	I often squashed several local git commits into one to make for easier to manage merging branches. Happy to
	discuss git at any interview.
	
	
	ok, so the code...

2. I've tried to separate concerns as logically as possible. To that end, access modifiers only allow the UI classes 
	to create a command via the constructor and fetch the output (of said command) as a string.
	
	Also, the Command class itself only checks the command syntax, and not the logic (e.g. is the request for
	outside the canvas?).
	
	I've made the Canvas class a singleton to ensure there only ever is one canvas.
	
3. Build wise, I've opted for maven so if you import the file as an existing maven project, it should build 
	in eclipse/IntelliJ no problems. To run just run ConsoleDraw as a Java Application.
	
4. Canvas has an ArrayList of the shapes drawn. This really isn't necessary as each shape draws directly onto the
	canvas pixels but I've left it in there. If we ever want to save Canvas objects, that would be the starting 
	point.
	
5. The bucketfill method was the real head-scratcher. It took me a few minutes to realise the recursive solution.
